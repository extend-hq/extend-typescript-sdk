    /**
     * The target format for the parsed content.
     *
     * Supported values:
     *
     * * `markdown`: True markdown with logical reading order (headings, lists, tables, checkboxes). Best default for LLMs/RAG and enables section-based chunking.
     * * `spatial`: Layout/position-preserving text that uses markdown elements for block types but is not strictly markdown due to whitespace/tabs used to maintain placement. Only page-based chunking is supported.
     *
     * Guidance:
     *
     * * Prefer `markdown` for most documents, multi-column reading order, and retrieval use cases
     * * Prefer `spatial` for messy/scanned/handwritten or skewed documents, when you need near 1:1 layout fidelity, or for BOL-like logistics docs
     *
     * See “Markdown vs Spatial” in the Parse guide for details: /2025-04-21/developers/guides/parse#markdown-vs-spatial
